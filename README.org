* fingers.el

  Modal editing for Emacs.

** Installation

   Add this repository to your =load-path= and load it via:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'fingers)
   #+end_src

   And then add additional bindings as needed. For example to trigger
   =magit-status= via =xg= in fingers-mode:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (define-key fingers-mode-x-map (kbd "g") 'magit-status)
   #+end_src

   Or to trigger =ag-project= via =k= in fingers-mode:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (define-key fingers-mode-map (kbd "k") 'ag-project)
   #+end_src

   For Qwerty users, use the following to change the basic mappings (not for =x=
   and =c= prefix):

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'fingers-qwerty)
     (setq fingers-keyboard-layout-mapper 'fingers-workman-to-qwerty)
     (fingers-reset-bindings)
     (setq fingers-selection-specifiers
           '((char . ?b)
             (char-and-whitespace . ?B)
             (line . ?f)
             (line-rest . ?r)
             (word . ?d)
             (word-and-whitespace . ?D)
             (symbol . ?e)
             (symbol-and-whitespace . ?E)
             (inside-pair . ?s)
             (with-pair . ?a)
             (with-pair-and-whitespace . ?A)))
   #+end_src

** Description

   - Based on ideas found in
     - boon: https://github.com/jyp/boon
     - god-mode: https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode

   - Minor mode that reduces usage of modifiers like Control and Meta

   - Easy navigation via right hand, basic text manipulation via left hand

   - Basic navigation all on left home row: beginning of line, left, down, up,
     right, end of line.

   - Basic text manipulation on right home row: enclose in pair, remove
     surrounding pair, yank, kill (with selection specifiers for word, symbol,
     whole line, between pairs, with pairs, with pairs and whitespace).

   - Prefers ease of key press over mnemonics.

   - Based on the Workman keyboard layout, supports basic mapping to other layouts

   - Invoke Meta bindings (=M-=) via =g= prefix. For example: =g;= to trigger
     =M-;= which is commonly bound to =comment-dwim=. Or =gq= to trigger =M-q=
     which is commonly bound to =fill-paragraph=.

** Details

   The following tables describe the current bindings when =fingers-mode= is
   active. The commands are sometimes abbreviated for formatting, you can always
   use =C-h k= to get the actual binding. Commands that are formatted like =a/b=
   indicate that =b= is bound to the upper case version of the key that triggers
   =a=.
